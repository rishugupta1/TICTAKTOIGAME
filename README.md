# TICTAKTOIGAME
Sure, here's a description of the provided code:

The code is a Python implementation of a tic-tac-toe game that supports both single-player (against the computer) and multi-player modes. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Board Representation (`ConstBoard`):**
   - The `ConstBoard` function is responsible for displaying the current state of the tic-tac-toe board. It takes a list representing the board as input and prints it in a user-friendly format.

2. **User Turns (`User1Turn`, `User2Turn`):**
   - The `User1Turn` and `User2Turn` functions handle the turns of the players. They prompt the user for input to specify their move ('X' or '0') and update the board accordingly. These functions also perform input validation to ensure that the chosen position is valid and not already occupied.

3. **Computer Turn (`CompTurn`):**
   - The `CompTurn` function implements the computer's turn in single-player mode. It uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the computer ('0'). The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and selects the one with the highest score. However, the code provided currently lacks the minimax function implementation.

4. **Game Logic (`analyseboard`, `main`):**
   - The `analyseboard` function checks the current state of the board to determine if there's a winner or if the game has ended in a draw. It iterates through the list of winning combinations to check if any player has won.
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It allows the user to choose between single-player and multi-player modes and then orchestrates the gameplay accordingly. It alternates between player turns until the game concludes, displaying the board after each move and announcing the winner or a draw at the end.

5. **User Interface:**
   - The user interface is primarily text-based, with prompts and messages displayed in the console. Players input their moves by entering positions corresponding to the cells of the tic-tac-toe board.

Overall, the code provides a functional implementation of a tic-tac-toe game with support for both single-player and multi-player modes. However, it currently lacks the minimax algorithm implementation for the computer's moves in single-player mode. With the addition of the minimax algorithm, the computer would be able to play optimally against the player.
